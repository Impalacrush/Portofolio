changelog:
1/22/2021 :recently i realize that some of the portofolio i made are not available on here so im trying to move some here, it will take time but in the meantime you can check my profile on kaggle by searching Triasbrahman, this is because i worked my data science at not on optimal platform and moving those to github might take more time that i would like to admit due to performance and connection issue, and for this i would like to apologize for the inconvenience.

1/28/2021 : If you are reading this, this portofolio consist 2 branches: projects and training, it is imperative that you understand this because im still trying to optimize this in the future because i still didnt fully understand github.
